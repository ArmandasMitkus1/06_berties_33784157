Overview

Lab 6 involved creating and deploying a small web application called Bertie’s Books using Node.js, Express, MySQL, and EJS.
The aim was to build a functional web app that connects to a MySQL database, renders pages with EJS, and is deployed on the Goldsmiths DOC server.

What Was Completed

Set up a Node.js + Express project

Created a MySQL database using create_db.sql

Inserted sample data using insert_test_data.sql

Implemented routes for:

/books/list – list all books

/addbook – add a new book

/bargainbooks – show discounted books

Built EJS templates for all required pages

Deployed the app on the DOC server using forever

Confirmed it is running on port 8000

Deployment

The server process is running with forever so the marker can access it.
